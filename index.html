    <h1> Hi </h1>
        <h2> My hobbies and interests </h2>
            <h3> <a href="scouts.html"> Scouts </a> </h3>
                <p> Scouts is a non-profit youth organization that operates in over 200 countries around the world. As of 2019 there were over 46 million scouts worldwide, both boys and girls, aged from 4-18. Scouts was started in the UK by Lord Robert Baden Powel back in 1907, and had a strong focus on preparing young boys to join the armed forces. This involved activities such as tracking, woodcraft, and first-aid. Though scouts has changed through the years, now providing a wider range of activities to accommodate anyone and everyone, these basic scouting activities still make up the backbone of what scouting is all about. </p>
                <p> I help out at scouts twice per week as a young leader. This involves planning and running activities and games for the children and making sure they have a fun, safe, and educational time. As well as regular evening sessions the scouts often go on weekend camps. Preparing for these camps involves preparing a menu for the weekend, working out what kit to bring and of course planning what will actually happen at camp. </p>
                <p> I have been a scout for ten years now and have been a young leader for two, scouts has taught me countless life skills, introduced me to new hobbies and has given me many many incredible memories and experiences. It is something that I strongly recommend everybody to try and I am very grateful for the opportunities that scouts has given me. </p>
            <h3> <a href="orienteering.html"> Orienteering </a> </h3>
                <p> Orienteering is a sport that involves running (or walking) with a map and compass in order to find all of your controls (checkpoints) in as short a time as possible. The first recorded use of the term 'Orienteering' dates all the way back to 1886 in Sweden. The word literally means 'to find the location'. It was originally used for military training but soon after, in 1897, the first public orienteering competition was held in Norway. Today there are thousands of registered orienteers, in over 70 countries, with many more who aren't registered and do the sport at a less competitive level. Today there are also many different forms of orienteering such as mountain bike or ski orienteering (MTBO/SkiO) that offer more variety and a new challenge. </p>
                <p> I have only been orienteering for about ten months but I have quickly found a love for the sport. It offers a unique challenge not only physically but also mentally. There is a lot to learn and it can be quite overwhelming however I am progressing quickly, having competed in both the largest UK orienteering event (JK's) and also the British Orienteering Championships. I am also hoping to go on an orienteering training week to the Czech Republic in a few months, an event usually only open to experienced orienteers.

            <h3> <a href="whiteWaterKayaking.html"> White Water Kayaking </a> </h3>
                <p> There are many types of white water kayaking such as river running, playboating, or squirt-boating. River running is by far the most well known and is what it says on the tin, paddlers get from point A to point B via kayaking down (or up) a river. White water is graded as to how dangerous it is, a grade one stretch of river is a nice relaxing paddle, however a grade six rapid has even the most experienced paddlers going pale. Playboating is another type of white water kayaking involving a paddler using the water features to manipulate the kayak in order to do tricks. This is often just done for fun but is also a recognized sport with regular 'freestyle' competitions where paddlers attempt to get the most points by doing more difficult or a greater number of tricks in the allocated time frame. </p>
                <p> I have been kayaking with my dad for as long as I can remember and have been paddling harder and more dangerous rapids as I have progressed. It is great fun, an excellent confidence builder, and often a chance to see some of the most beautiful parts of the UK. </p>
